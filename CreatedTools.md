## [Multivariate Logistic Regression Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HaukahFWy0aqA3HnhiwfeCcAHFHWu6Q0ylW7QCRIbY/edit?usp=sharing)
A Google Sheets Tool to analyze a dataset in the logistic regression lens. Set up what variables to analyze and how many bins to use, to then understand where the model holds best and optimize the regular model with the gradient descent machine learning algorithm.
